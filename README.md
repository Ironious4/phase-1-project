# Topic:Project

# Purpose
To complete a project using my current knowledge and skills of HTML,CSS and
Javascript


# Setting up the enviroment
Set up the coding environment through these steps:
 1. Create a github repository for the assignment.
 2. Create a directory for the assignments.(mkdir folder name)
 3. Create the necessary files for the work(touch file.txt)
 4. Get started on the assignments.


# Structure
The structure of this directory is as follows:
1. images
2. cart.js
3. db.json
4. index.css
5. index.html
6. package.json
7. README.md


# Procedure
The whole project involves developing a product cart for an E-commerce website for users to store their products where they are required to register and login with their credentials and thereafter they can add products to the cart and remove them at their own will.

# Working through errors
The codes should be run through the live server in the browser in order to confirm whether the codes are working.If they are not working, the live server should display the errors in the codes which should give clues on how to rectify the errors.


# Submitting work done
After finishing the project, the following should be done:
1. Save your changes
2. Link your local repository with your remote repository(git remote add origin).
3. Add your files(git add .)
4. Commit your changes(git commit -m "message")
5. Push your changes to the remote repository(git push origin branch name)

After finishing these steps you should see your updates changes in your github profile.
 
Before we forget,the work is to be submitted to canvas. Simply paste the URL of the work in the submission section of the code challenge and click on submit assignment.

That's pretty much it! The project has been successfully completed and submitted!
